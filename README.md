## Usage

Once you have installed SecAI, you can start using it in your projects. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to create a network of AI agents:

```python
from secai import Agent, Network

# Create a network
network = Network()

# Create agents
agent1 = Agent(name="Agent 1")
agent2 = Agent(name="Agent 2")

# Add agents to the network
network.add_agent(agent1)
network.add_agent(agent2)

# Establish communication
agent1.send_message("Hello from Agent 1!")
response = agent2.receive_message()
print(response)
```

### Advanced Features

SecAI also allows for more advanced configurations, such as setting up asynchronous communication and integrating with deep learning models. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

```python
from secai import AsyncAgent

async_agent = AsyncAgent(name="Async Agent")
await async_agent.perform_task("Analyze data")
```

Explore the documentation for more detailed examples and use cases.
